# landingPageFWD
A project related to the FWD web development scholarship that requires adding more functions to a static web page using JavaScript code.

## Features I have added to the static webpage using JavaScript:
1. Generating the navigation menu.
2. Functionality to scroll to sections smoothly.
3. Functionality to distinguish the section in view.
4. Added an active state to a navigation item when its section is in the viewport.
5. Hide fixed navigation bar while not scrolling.
6. Navigation bar should still be present while dragging or on page load.
7. Add a scroll to top button on the page thatâ€™s only visible when the user scrolls to the end of the page.
8. Provided the ability to add more sections.
9. Make sections collapsible.
10. Hiding or showing a horizontal scroll bar into the navigation menu according to the size of the screen.
11. On PC: You can do "Drag-Scrolling" oo the navigation menu. can scroll by holding a click & dragging as if you are using a phone.

Here's a diagram that I made while the thinking process about how to hide the navigation menu after certain time of inactivity (not scrolling).
